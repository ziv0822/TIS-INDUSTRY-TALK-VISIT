## Reflection
### How Innovation Helps Human Life

From these industry visits and the industrial talk, I gained valuable insight into how innovation and ICT systems help improve human life, particularly in terms of safety, efficiency and productivity. Technologies such as ERP systems, databases, automation and access management reduce manual workload, minimize human error and shorten processing time. This allows workers to perform their tasks in a safer and more comfortable working environment.

In addition, system integration and real-time data support better decision-making and smoother daily operations across different departments. Through examples from UTM Digital, PPG and Johor Port, I learned that innovation is not only about advanced technology, but also about how technology supports people in handling complex tasks more effectively.

Overall, these activities motivated me to appreciate the role of ICT in improving working conditions, operational efficiency and the overall quality of life in both educational and industrial environments.
